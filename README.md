## What is a zkOS?

A zkOS takes a different approach to most infrastructure projects we are currently seeing. Instead of building a vertical ecosystem, we believe that creating an open layer will enable faster growth and will enable zk to become mainstream faster. We see our zkOS evolving into a protocol which will serve a multitude of core functions necessary for deploying any zk-based dApp:

* Scale - We want to allow apps to achieve scale and cost effectiveness, by allowing different apps to collaborate and aggregate their proofs into a single final proof to be posted on chain.
* Interoperability - We are in the early innings of innovation in zk. We believe that creating a unified API for zk will encourage the creation of different approaches which will fit different problems.
* Batteries included - Most zk libraries aren't ready to deployment, we would like to make it easy and quick to reach production, without needing to rebuild everything yourself.

**It is important to note this code is unaudited and is NOT ready for production use.** We are working very closely with several auditors to turn this prototype into something production ready. 

## What is included?

We chose to showcase how powerful this approach can be by leveraging two leading (and fully open source) implementations -- Winterfell and Risc0. Our main example showcases how **two** Fibonacci proofs (generated by Winterfell) are verified within a Risc0 zkVM. This example shows a roadmap for achieving interoperability and scale -- we can verify zk proofs coming from different systems and aggregate them into a single final proof which can be verified on-chain. 

## Roadmap

| Milestone | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| Risc0 recursion | Unlocks multi-layer recursion | 
| Deployment of WASM verifier | Start experimenting with on-chain proofs |  
| Solidity verifier for Risc0 | EVM on-chain proofs |
| Miden support | Allow full cross-VM interoperability |

## Benchmarks

(To be added)

## Quickstart

* Ensure you've cloned the repo with all submodules
* Install rustup
* This project uses a nightly version of Rust. The rust-toolchain file will be used by cargo to automatically install the correct version.
* cd recursive
* cargo run --release -- please note, compilation time will be high (around 20 minutes on MacBook M1) due to Risc0 circuit size configuration. For development use-cases, feel free to modify [the build configuration](https://github.com/starkoracles/risc0-test/blob/main/recursive/methods/build.rs#L8) to 12.
